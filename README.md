Hi there!

You've come across a 3D printable 
The object is to be rendered through openScad.

# Capabilities
So far, it can allocate up to 4 5G/4G antennas.
The antenna spacing is ideal to work at 3.95 GHz.
Its removable feet make it stable and portable.

# Prep work
By openScad rules, the base unit depends on the slicer you use.
Check that out and change the unit converter before printing your object.
(if this step is ignored, the object might result 10 times smaller/bigger)

# Future work
In the future, we plan to have a:
- Configurable block, depending on the central frequency in use and the number of antennas that you want to allocate.
- run_3D.sh a script that modifies the block based on your necessities (see point above).
